config constants:
    PATH  ->  the default cursebox dir where all the files live


  tailbox (shortens to bx)
$  bx       |  add     |\
            |          | \
            |  edit    |--\ (all same arguments for the below)

            |          |     \

            |                  | * recurrent -->  a MULTI-TICK reminder
            |                  | * wishlist  --> intended to be for things like games releases, show releases, etc. 
            |                  |    
            |                  |    ^ these will ask for datetimes
            |                  |      (wishlist is optional on datetime)
            |
            |                  | * todo      --> intended to print from shellrc on open, all about being annoying and fixable
            |                  | * idea      --> intended for quick jots when on the command line, decluttering my other CLI spaces
            |
            |   FLAGS
            |  filter    |  -f      --> filters results from e.g. the file being pulled from
            |  help      |  -h      --> goes anywhere, prints help if called with function, or just prints all CLI API args' helps
            |  home      |  -dir    --> maybe easy migrate all of bx's stuff?
