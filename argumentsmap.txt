            |                  | * todo      --> intended to print from shellrc on open, all about being annoying and fixable
            |                  | * idea      --> intended for quick jots when on the command line, decluttering my other CLI spaces
            |                  | * cron      --> intended for simple cron jobs, might be future chunk feature for myself

            |  help      |  -h      --> goes anywhere, prints help if called with function, or just prints all CLI API args' helps
            |  home      |  -dir    --> maybe easy migrate all of bx's stuff?
            |  conf      | -c, --conf
